### File Breakdown

- <b>Comment Predictor.ipynb:</b> Utilitzes a neural network to naively score comments based on weights we calculated.
- <b>LSTM Comment Predictor.ipynb:</b> Utilizes a LSTM neural network to predict the toxicity score. This is a common strategy to solve this problem
- <b>Prelim_Data_Prep.ipynb:</b> Takes a look at all the data and certain features. Trims, stems, and lemmatizes the data to prep for machine learning. 
- <b>Exploration.ipynb:</b> Utilizes statistical methods and other classifiers to try to predict toxicty based on the data set that contains many features. 
- <b>data-requirements.txt:</b> python requirements file to import most of the required libraries we used for our notebooks.
